Repo title: credit_risk_classification
(Module 20)

Analysis

This analysis assesses whether the machine learning prediction model can reliably predict the credit risk of borrowers, based on historical data collected by the lending service.


- The dataset contains 77536 loans and records the following information in its columns:
'loan_size'
'interest_rate'
'borrower_income'
'debt_to_income'
'num_of_accounts'
'derogatory_marks'
'total_debt'
'loan_status'

The goal is to identify the `loan_status` variable, where `0` indicates a healthy, low-risk loan and `1` indicates a high-risk loan.  

- The distribution of the target variable was as follows:
  - Healthy loans (0): *majority class*
  - High-risk loans (1): *minority class*
- The stages of the machine learning process included:
  - Load the data and explore the dataset.
  - Separate data into labels and features (`X` and `y`)
  - Splitting data to create training and testing sets.
  - Model and train selection with `LogisticRegression`
  - Run the prediction model on the test set
  - Evaluate the quality of the outcome by creating the confusion matrix and assessing the classification report

## Results

* ML Model 1: Logistic Regression
    
	Accuracy: 0.99
    	Precision:
        * Class 0 (Healthy Loans): 1.00
        * Class 1 (High-Risk Loans): 0.84

    	Recall:
        - Class 0: 0.99
        - Class 1: 0.94

## Conclusion

The logistic regression model is performing exceptionally well. For the healthy loans (class 0), the model achieves a recall rate of approximately 99.9%, indicating that it effectively identifies nearly all healthy loans. The F1 score of 1 suggests that the model has achieved an optimal balance between precision and recall for this class.

On the other hand, the performance for high-risk loans (Class 1) is slightly lower, with the model correctly predicting 85% of these loans. This means that 15% of the loans were misclassified, which could be disappointing for lenders. 

However, the model successfully identified 91% of all high-risk loans in the dataset, demonstrating strong performance.

Overall, while there is room for improvement in classifying high-risk loans, the model's predictions for healthy loans are highly reliable, making it a valuable tool for lenders.
